  abstract  = {A growing number of software solutions have been proposed to address application-level energy consumption problems in the last few years. However, little is known about how much software developers are concerned about energy consumption, what aspects of energy consumption they consider important, and what solutions they have in mind for improving energy efficiency. In this paper we present the first empirical study on understanding the views of application programmers on software energy consumption problems. Using StackOverflow as our primary data source, we analyze a carefully curated sample of more than 300 questions and 550 answers from more than 800 users. With this data, we observed a number of interesting findings. Our study shows that practitioners are aware of the energy consumption problems: the questions they ask are not only diverse -- we found 5 main themes of questions -- but also often more interesting and challenging when compared to the control question set. Even though energy consumption-related questions are popular when considering a number of different popularity measures, the same cannot be said about the quality of their answers. In addition, we observed that some of these answers are often flawed or vague. We contrast the advice provided by these answers with the state-of-the-art research on energy consumption. Our summary of software energy consumption problems may help researchers focus on what matters the most to software developers and end users.},

  abstract   = {In recent years, there has been a rapid evolution of energyaware computing systems (e.g., mobile devices, wireless sensor nodes), as still rising system complexity and increasing user demands make energy a permanently scarce resource. While static and dynamic optimizations for energy-aware execution have been explored massively, writing energyefficient programs in the first place has only received limited attention. This paper proposes SEEP, a framework which exploits symbolic execution and platform-specific energy profiles to provide the basis for energy-aware programming. More specifically, the framework provides developers with information about the energy demand of their code at hand, even for the invocation of library functions and in settings with multiple possibly strongly heterogeneous target platforms. This equips developers with the necessary knowledge to take energy demand into account during the task of writing programs.},

For each method of an implementation in this framework, we present its energy consumption when handling different amounts of data.

  abstract  = {With the anticipated dramatic growth of computing devices for mobile and embedded environments, energy conscious hardware and software design has taken center-stage together with performance. At the same time, there is an increasing need to provide a portable and seamless software environment for application development and interoperability. This paper takes an important step in the confluence of these two emerging trends, by examining the energy behavior of the memory system in the execution of Java applications. It is crucial to understand and optimize the energy behavior of the memory system since instructions referencing memory can contribute to a large fraction of the energy consumption when executing Java applications.Using an off-the-shelf JVM, a validated memory energy model, and a detailed simulator, this paper presents a characterization of the energy consumption by the cache and main memory when executing the SPEC JVM98 benchmarks in the JIT and interpreter modes. The energy consumption is profiled for the different hard-ware components (instruction cache, data cache, memory) and software components (class loading, garbage collection, dynamic compilation). The results from such a characterization are useful to the hardware designer for cache organizations and architectural enhancements for reducing energy consumption. They are also useful to the application and runtime system designer to identify energy bottlenecks, and for code restructuring or algorithm redesign to alleviate these bottlenecks.},

We review economic concepts underlying consumer decision making in energy efficiency and conservation and examine related empirical literature. In particular, we provide an economic perspective on the range of market barriers, market failures, and behavioral failures that have been cited in the energy efficiency context. We assess the extent to which these conditions provide a motivation for policy intervention in energy-using product markets, including an examination of the evidence on policy effectiveness and cost. Although theory and empirical evidence suggests there is potential for welfare-enhancing energy efficiency policies, many open questions remain, particularly relating to the extent of some key market and behavioral failures.}

Indeed, little tool support exists to understand the energy consumption pro le of a software system and to eventually (automatically) improve its code.  In this paper we present a tool termed jStanley which automatically nds collections in Java programs that can be replaced by others with a positive impact on the energy consumption as well as on the execution time. In seconds, developers obtain information about energy-eager collection usage. jStanley will further suggest alternative collections to improve the code, making it use less time, energy, or a combination of both. The preliminary evaluation we ran using jStanley shows energy gains between 2\% and 17\%, and a reduction in execution time between 2\% and 13\%.

  abstract  = {We created detailed profiles of the energy consumed by common operations done on Java List, Map, and Set abstractions. The results show that the alternative data types for these abstractions differ significantly in terms of energy consumption depending on the operations. For example, an ArrayList consumes less energy than a LinkedList if items are inserted at the middle or at the end, but consumes more energy than a LinkedList if items are inserted at the start of the list. To explain the results, we explored the memory usage and the bytecode executed during an operation. Expensive computation tasks in the analyzed bytecode traces appeared to have an energy impact, but memory usage did not contribute. We evaluated our profiles by using them to selectively replace Collections types used in six applications and libraries. We found that choosing the wrong Collections type, as indicated by our profiles, can cost even 300\% more energy than the most efficient choice. Our work shows that the usage context of a data structure and our measured energy profiles can be used to decide between alternative Collections implementations.},
