In the start of the project, some tools were tested in order to see how to get the energy profiles for later use. The tools tested were PowerJoular, Powertop, Perf and JoularJx.

Perf is a Linux tool primarily designed for analyzing application performance characteristics rather than precise energy measurement. While it can provide some energy-related metrics, its measurements tend to be imprecise. In this context, Perf was used mainly to get a rough idea of energy consumption and to serve as an alternative when more accurate tools were unavailable.

Powertop was also tested, but it could only perform energy measurements on laptops, as it relies on battery drain data to calculate energy consumption. Since this approach doesn't align with our specific requirements, we considered Powertop as a last-resort option.

JoularJx is an energy measurement tool capable of measuring the consumption of Java programs and its methods. However, it is not as precise as other tools as it requires to measure the entire start of the JVM and whole functions instead of small code blocks.

As described in the \ref{sec:background_energy}, PowerJoular is the best option. As a command line program it can be easily adapted to measure any program or code snippet in most languages. So it was combined with the framework experiment-runner, that facilitates the process.

Initially, JoularJx and the experiment-runner using PowerJoular were used to explore their capabilities and familiarize with the tools. A sample Fibonacci program written in Java and C was used as a test case. However, the energy measurements provided by the two tools differed, and the experiment runner occasionally encountered errors. Later, it was determined that these problems were due to incorrect use of the framework. However, it was still decided the best approach was to make a new orchestrator similar to the Experiment-Runner, but simpler and specifically focused on measuring process energy consumption using PowerJoular. A Java-based orchestrator was initially developed because the Fibonacci implementation was also in Java. However, when tested, the energy measurement results differed significantly from those of the experiment runner, even though the main difference was the programming language (Java vs. Python).

To further analyze these inconsistencies, another orchestrator was developed in Python. This allowed for a closer examination of the differences in energy measurements and a deeper understanding of the behavior of the tools.

Using the process explained on \ref{sec:work} it was noticeable that the Java orchestrator was getting significantly more energy consumption than the Python one, which is not very logical, since they both target the same program. So, to try and check which one was having problems, two more orchestrators were implemented, one in C and another in bash.

After running the tests again it was possible to see that the Python orchestrator was getting values way more different from the other three orchestrators as show in Figure \ref{fig:4_orchs_comparison}.
The figure contains 100 runs of the Fibonacci recursive program written in Java and order by the less energy to the highest energy. And it shows the energy reads for the four different orchestrators used. The labels contain the average energy values and its standard deviation.

Further analysis of the orchestrators revealed a notable difference in behavior. When the Python orchestrator was running, both the parent and child processes consumed CPU resources. In contrast, the other orchestrators (Java, C, and Bash) showed CPU usage only in the child process. This disparity may explain why PowerJoular reported lower energy consumption for the Python orchestrator. Since the CPU load was shared between the parent and child processes, PowerJoular, which measures energy only for the child process (the target Fibonacci program), captured less total energy usage.
Since the experiment runner included an example demonstrating how to use the framework with PowerJoular, the authors were made aware of this potential conflict when launching PowerJoular from Python.
