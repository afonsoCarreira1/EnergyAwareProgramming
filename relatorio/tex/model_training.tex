\section{Stage 3: Model Training} \label{sec:work_stage3_model_training}

Now, that all the energy profiles are collected it is possible to finally start training the models. As explained in \ref{sec:background_machine_learning} there are a lot of possible ways of using machine learning, however in this case the approach that best fit our need is supervised machine learning. So, some models were trained to see how good they performed using the data collected.
